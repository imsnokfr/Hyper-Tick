üìÑ Product Requirements Document (PRD) ‚Äî TickLock Mod
1. Goal

Create a Minecraft Fabric client-side mod that makes input handling (especially hotbar swaps, crystal PvP combos, and shield disables) more consistent by implementing a high-frequency input buffer and aligning actions with the server‚Äôs 20 TPS tick system.

The mod should preserve the player‚Äôs intended input sequence while preventing accidental drops/skips caused by Minecraft‚Äôs ‚Äúlast input per tick wins‚Äù rule.

2. Key Features

High-Frequency Input Buffer

Capture player inputs (hotbar swaps, item use, attack, interact) at a higher resolution (e.g. 500‚Äì1000Hz).

Store inputs in a rolling buffer until the next tick is processed.

Tick Downsampling

At each server tick (20 TPS), flush the buffer into a clean output.

Rules:

Default = first input per tick wins (instead of last).

Optionally allow priority mode (e.g. certain slots/items are favored).

Hotbar Priority Handling

Allow custom slot priority (e.g. Axe > Sword > Crystal).

If multiple swaps land in one tick, resolve them using the priority rules.

Combo Consistency

Ensure common PvP sequences (crystal ‚Üí punch ‚Üí totem, axe ‚Üí sword, anchor ‚Üí glowstone) execute reliably.

Reduce ‚Äúfumbled swaps‚Äù caused by tick timing randomness.

Config Options

Toggle between First-input mode and Last-input mode.

Define slot priority order in config/ticklock.json.

Adjustable buffer rate (default 1000Hz).

Safety

Client-only mod (no server-side changes).

No automated actions ‚Äî only preserves real player inputs.


4. Success Criteria

Player can consistently perform shield disables and crystal PvP combos without random drops.

Input timing feels smoother at any FPS (60 ‚Üí 240+).

Mod runs without server crashes, since all logic is client-side.

Config file allows customization without recompiling.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Specifications
1. Environment

Minecraft: 1.21 and later more

Loader: Fabric

Language: Java (Yarn mappings)


2. Input Capture

Hook into:

KeyBinding.onKeyPressed ‚Üí for hotbar swaps, attack, use, interact.

ClientTickEvents.END_CLIENT_TICK ‚Üí to poll buffer flush.

Optional: Screen.onKeyPressed ‚Üí if you want it to work in GUIs.

Store each input as:

class BufferedInput {
    long timestamp;   // exact system time in ms
    int slot;         // hotbar slot (0-8)
    InputType type;   // ATTACK, USE, SWAP, PLACE, etc.
}

3. Buffer System

Buffer rate: 1000Hz (1ms resolution).

Flush: every 50ms (server tick).

Resolution Rule:

Default: first input wins.

Optional: slot priority list.

Pseudocode:

onTick() {
    List<BufferedInput> inputs = buffer.collectSinceLastTick();
    if (inputs.isEmpty()) return;
    
    BufferedInput chosen = pickByMode(inputs); 
    executeInput(chosen);
}

4. Config

File: config/ticklock.json

Example:

{
  "mode": "FIRST", 
  "buffer_rate": 1000,
  "priority_slots": [2, 1, 9, 8] 
}

5. Edge Cases

If no input is present in a tick ‚Üí do nothing.

If multiple identical inputs ‚Üí only execute once.

If player is dead or in GUI ‚Üí ignore buffer.

6. Future Enhancements

GUI to adjust slot priorities in-game.

Debug overlay showing inputs vs outputs.

Per-item priority (instead of per-slot).
